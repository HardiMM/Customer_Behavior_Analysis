**Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**
**Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using an end-to-end data analysis workflow. It includes loading and exploring the dataset in Python, performing data cleaning, running SQL queries in PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server, and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard. The final deliverables include a structured analytical report and a presentation built using Gamma.

**Dataset:**
The dataset contains customer demographic details, purchase information, shopping behavior, and product attributes.
Key fields include age, gender, location, item purchased, category, purchase amount, discount usage, review ratings, shipping type, and subscription status.

**Tools and Technologies:**
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
Power BI
Jupyter Notebook
Gamma (for presentation)

**Project Steps**
1. Data Loading:
Imported the dataset in Python using pandas
Inspected data structure, column types, and basic statistics

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Summary statistics, distributions, and value counts
Visual exploration to identify trends, outliers, and behavior patterns

3. Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
Standardized column names and formats
Removed duplicate or inconsistent records
Created additional features where necessary

4. SQL Analysis:
Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server
Performed queries to extract business insights, such as:
Revenue analysis
Customer segmentation
Product performance
Discount and subscription behavior
Shipping preference insights

5. Dashboard Development:
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key findings
Included charts for revenue trends, customer groups, product categories, and behavioral patterns

6. Reporting and Presentation:
Documented insights and recommendations in a structured report
Created a professional presentation using Gamma to summarize the analysis

**Results*
Identified important factors driving customer purchases
Highlighted high-value customer segments and top-performing products
Analyzed the impact of discounts, subscriptions, and shipping types
Provided actionable recommendations for improving retention and sales strategies

**How to Run**
Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the Jupyter notebook and install required Python libraries
Load the dataset into the notebook
Run each section step-by-step to reproduce the analysis
Load the cleaned dataset into your preferred SQL database
Execute the SQL scripts included in the repository
